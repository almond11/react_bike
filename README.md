# Weather Widget

[Demo](https://m-michelini-weather-widget.glitch.me/)

A weather application that gets the weather at a given location, or the users
current location if permission is given. The app was built with Node.js
and Express on the backend, and React.js on the client side. All data and icons related to
weather are from [Openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/).
